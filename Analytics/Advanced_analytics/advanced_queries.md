## **Introduction**  
This document contains advanced **data analysis** of sales performance over time, cumulative analysis, product trends,customer segmentation.
The goal is to uncover **key patterns, trends, and insights** that can drive data-driven decision-making.  

By analyzing sales across **different time periods, product categories, and customer segments**, we aim to identify:  
- Seasonal trends and long-term growth patterns üìÖ  
- Top-performing products and underperforming items üõçÔ∏è  
- High-value customer groups and retention strategies üë•
